Hospital Appointment Scheduler
This is my project for Assignment 6. I built a simple web app that helps hospitals manage doctor bookings fairly without overworking the staff.

# Features

Add Doctors: Quickly register doctors with their specialty and daily patient limit.


Live List: See all doctors and their current workload in one table.


Fair Booking: A "Book Now" feature that finds the best available doctor.


Alert System: A status panel that tells you if a booking worked or if doctors are full.

When you book an appointment, the app does this:


Filters for the specialty you need.


Picks the doctor with the fewest current appointments.

Example: If Dr. A has 2 patients and Dr. B has 0, the system automatically gives the next patient to Dr. B to keep things even.
